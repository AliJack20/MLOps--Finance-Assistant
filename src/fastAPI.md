Overview

The D7 Model Prediction API is a containerized FastAPI service designed to serve predictions from a trained machine learning model stored on AWS S3.
It provides REST endpoints for health checks, model inference, and system monitoring.
FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation through /docs (Swagger UI) and /redoc (ReDoc).

To test the predict endpoint locally:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "instances": [
             { "feature1": 1.2, "feature2": 3.4 },
             { "feature1": 5.6, "feature2": 7.8 }
           ]
         }'


Example Output

{
  "predictions": [12345.67, 98765.43]
}
