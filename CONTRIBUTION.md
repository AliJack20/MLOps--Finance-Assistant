Branch-naming Convention

We followed the repository’s conventional prefixes for clarity and traceability:

- feat/<short-description> — new features (e.g., new endpoint, pipeline step)
- fix/<short-description> — bug fixes
- infra/<short-description> — infrastructure changes (Docker, Compose, Terraform, CI)
- docs/<short-description> — documentation updates (README, guides)
- chore/<short-description> — maintenance tasks (deps, formatting)

Notes

- Use short, imperative descriptions after the prefix, for example: `feat/add-prediction-endpoint`.
- Link PRs to issues when applicable and provide a brief "What/Why" in the PR body.
